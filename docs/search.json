Back in the late 1990s, I built a 6” Dobsonian telescope with several other club members. It was a blast.\nThe club is gearing up for multiple activities in 2024, including a trip to Erie, PA to watch the eclipse.\nOne of the activities involves encouraging members to build home radiotelescopes and to contribute data to the Radio JOVE project. So, I ordered the kit, and it arrived late last week.\nThe kit consists of a pair of dipole antennas tuned to ~20 MHz, a combiner, some coax feed lines and phasing lines, and a software defined radio (SDR). If I have time to put the pieces together before April 8, but if not, I’ll get it online in the next couple of months.\nI love the project for many reasons not least of which is the fact that it combines two of my favorite hobbies. Now, if I could just figure out how to combine ham radio and banjos."

    "text": "I’ve wanted to be a ham since I was a teen.\nI started out as a shortwave listener with a long wire strung from my parents’ roof on our house in southwest Denver running to Yaesu FRG-7 receiver. Hearing the English language broadcast from Radio Tirana in Albania was one of the highlights.\nIn the spring of 1993, I got the ham bug again and studied for an passed my Technician Plus exam, including the 5 wpm code requirement. My callsign was N3QLO. But I had just gotten married and just started graduate school. So, I made one contact on a Radio Shack HT and largely forgot about ham radio. In fact, when my license renewal rolled around in 2003, I didn’t even bother to renew.\nThirteen years later, I’d gotten tenure, my kids were teens or out of the house, and I had a little more time and energy. I passed my Technician and General license exams in the summer of 2016, secured the vanity callsign K3ROG, and joined the Nittany Amateur Radio Club. This time, I made time for ham radio, and I’ve been rolling ever since. With the help of some study partners and my Elmer K3YV, I upgraded to Extra a year later.\nIn the winter of 2023, I changed callsigns again to W3TM, mostly on a lark. I saw that a callsign that was both phonetically short and CW-short was available, and so I decided to enter the callsign lottery when it became available. My understanding was that the chances were slim I would get the callsign, but I thought I would go for it anyway. Sure enough, there was only one other ham who was eligible, and I won the coin toss at the FCC. Ok, maybe they have a more sophisticated system of choosing randomly, but however it went down, whiskey-three-tango-mike was now my new call. And that call will remain until I am a silent key.\n\n\n\nW3TM QSL card"
