    "text": "I’ve wanted to be a ham since I was a teen.\nI started out as a shortwave listener with a long wire strung from my parents’ roof on our house in southwest Denver running to Yaesu FRG-7 receiver. Hearing the English language broadcast from Radio Tirana in Albania was one of the highlights.\nIn the spring of 1993, I got the ham bug again and studied for an passed my Technician Plus exam, including the 5 wpm code requirement. My callsign was N3QLO. But I had just gotten married and just started graduate school. So, I made one contact on a Radio Shack HT and largely forgot about ham radio. In fact, when my license renewal rolled around in 2003, I didn’t even bother to renew.\nThirteen years later, I’d gotten tenure, my kids were teens or out of the house, and I had a little more time and energy. I passed my Technician and General license exams in the summer of 2016, secured the vanity callsign K3ROG, and joined the Nittany Amateur Radio Club. This time, I made time for ham radio, and I’ve been rolling ever since. With the help of some study partners and my Elmer K3YV, I upgraded to Extra a year later.\nIn the winter of 2023, I changed callsigns again to W3TM, mostly on a lark. I saw that a callsign that was both phonetically short and CW-short was available, and so I decided to enter the callsign lottery when it became available. My understanding was that the chances were slim I would get the callsign, but I thought I would go for it anyway. Sure enough, there was only one other ham who was eligible, and I won the coin toss at the FCC. Ok, maybe they have a more sophisticated system of choosing randomly, but however it went down, whiskey-three-tango-mike was now my new call. And that call will remain until I am a silent key.\n\n\n\nW3TM QSL card"

    "text": "Packet\nI’ve recently assembled a portable VHF packet/APRS/Winlink station. The radio is the ICOM ID-51a. A Digirig device with a cable specifically designed for ICOM HTs provides sound card and PTT functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ID-51a supports CAT control via CI-V, and Digirig could support this. But CAT control is overkill for this use case. It’s trivial to change the radio frequency manually, and the mode does not need to change.\nThe Digirig cable takes the grounded speaker line from the ID-51a and sends it as an RTS signal to the computer. So, once I’ve set the packet software to use the correct COM port on the PC, PTT works well. The virtue of this scheme is that it can also work with other HTs.\n\n\nAn Evolve III netbook running Windows 10 runs the relevant software. I’m using the UH7HO Soundmodem package for packet radio TNC services, Dire Wolf as an APRS TNC, and Outpost Packet Message Manager as a packet terminal client. I also use Winlink, and the VARA FM Winlink client, but of course, I could also use standard packet as the Winlink client.\nThe IC-705 can also work as a portable FM + HF packet station using the same PC. I’m experimenting with making different copies of Soundmodem and VARA FM and then naming them for the different rig configurations, as neither package supports switching between multiple rigs."

The default is COM 10.\nCheck Audio inputs and outputs\nThere should be two Digirig (USB Audio Devices).\n\n\n\n\nPower up the rig, if it’s not already powered up.\n\n\nTune to digital mode frequency, e.g. 7.070 MHz (PSK31).\nConfirm that mode is USB Data (D-U).\n\n\nOpen fldigi.\n\n\nConfirm that flrig launches, that fldigi launches, and that the frequency of the rig is reflected in flrig and fldigi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFlrig settings:\nConfigure menu / Setup / Transceiver\nRig: FT-891 Port: COM10 Baud: 9600 (note this is controlled on rig under menu 05-06 CAT RATE)\nIs flrig connected to rig? If so, Connected light will be green.\nIf not, press Init button to initiate/test connection.\n\n\n\nConfirm/edit fldigi settings\n\nSoundcard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConfigure menu / Configure dialog / Soundcard / Devices\nPortAudio: Checked Capture: Digirig (USB Audio interface) Playback: Digirig (USB Audio interface)\nAudio device shared by Audio Alerts and Rx Monitor:\nEnable: If checked, select Speakers as output so as not to transmit system audio over the air.\n\n\nRig Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEnable flrig xcvr control with fldigi as client: Checked Shutdown flrig with fldigi: Checked\n\n\n\nTest transmit by pressing TUNE\n\nMonitor output on rig with F / MTR / PO. Power output on power meter should be comparable to output set on rig (~5-50 W). Rig menu is 16-03 HF PWR.\nAdjust the output level by switching to F / MTR / ALC. Press tune. Then use the sndvol applet on the PC to reduce the speaker output until the ALC is at a minimum. To launch sndvol type it into the search bar and press enter.\n::: {.callout-warning}\nBecause digital modes are high duty-cycle modes, it’s best to use less than the full 100 W of output power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt can be useful to monitor the input (mic) and output (speaker) audio device levels on the PC.\nType “Control Panel” in the search bar. Open Hardware and Sound and open the Digirig output (from PC) or Speaker panel or the Digirig input (to PC) or Mic panel.\nPer Digirig instructions, the PC Speaker output is initially set at ~80%. But I have found that to reduce the ALC to a minimum means that my speaker level is ~15%.\nThe Mic level can be adjusted to achieve ideal “input” levels for a digital mode OR the rig RF Gain can be reduced. The latter control is more easily adjusted given different operating conditions.\nFull RF Gain results when the outer RF Gain knob on the rig is turned fully clockwise (to the right)."

Back in the late 1990s, I built a 6” Dobsonian telescope with several other club members. It was a blast.\nThe club is gearing up for multiple activities in 2024, including a trip to Erie, PA to watch the eclipse.\nOne of the activities involves encouraging members to build home radiotelescopes and to contribute data to the Radio JOVE project. So, I ordered the kit, and it arrived late last week.\nThe kit consists of a pair of dipole antennas tuned to ~20 MHz, a combiner, some coax feed lines and phasing lines, and a software defined radio (SDR). If I have time to put the pieces together before April 8, but if not, I’ll get it online in the next couple of months.\nI love the project for many reasons not least of which is the fact that it combines two of my favorite hobbies. Now, if I could just figure out how to combine ham radio and banjos."

I used it for Field Day from my backyard in 2020. The 30 Ah (orange) and 40 Ah (black) battery boxes can also be seen in the picture below.\n\n\n\nPowerWerx solar panels & BioEnno batteries\n\n\nI have two foldable 65 W solar panels that can be daisy-chained (in series). I used them in a recent portable operation in support of a mountain bike race.\n\n\nCharge controllers\nTwo charge controllers are available. One came with my Bioenno panels.\n\n\n\nBioenno Solar Charge Controller SC-4830JUD\n\n\nThe other is the BuddiPole PowerMini2.\n\n\n\nBuddiPole PowerMini2\n\n\nThe PowerMini2 is a great little charge controller, but it is pricey and not often available because of high demand."

Apparently, there is a USB control option that I have yet to explore.\nHowever, I do use and enjoy remote control of my IC-7300 using the RemoteTx.net service. This service allows me to access my IC-7300 from a web browser.\nI have experimented with remote control via an early version of the RigPi station server."

Access to the IC-7610 is easy via the MacOS SDR-Control or iOS SDR-Mobile apps, but this requires connecting to the NARC VPN. Access to the Flex 6400M can be made via SmartLink and SmartSDR for Windows, Mac OS, or iOS. We have a very nice array of antennas “up at the mountain,” so this has been an enjoyable experiment."
