I bought this amplifier used in the summer of 2021.

Input 1 connects to the [Flex-6400](rigs.qmd#flexradio-6400), and Input 2 connects to the [ICOM IC-7300](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-7300).

## VHF amplifier

This amplifier is part of an integrated "accessory" bench I built for the [IC-705](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-705).
