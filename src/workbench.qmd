Inspired by the [Ham Radio Workbench](https://www.hamradioworkbench.com) podcast bunch, here are a number of projects that are on my workbench.
Really, some of these are aspirational.
And some aren't really things that go on a workbench.

## Science

With the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse on the horizon, I'm working on two 
citizen science projects:

- A weak signal propagation reporter (WSPR) station to provide data to the
[HamSCI](https://hamsci.org) team about changes in atmospheric propagation during the eclipse. I will likely put my home station on the air. Whether I put a portable station, depends on weather conditions close to the eclipse.

- A portable radio telescope from the [Radio JOVE](https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov) project that I will deploy to help this group study the Sun and Jupiter. I'm planning to make this radio telescope portable, so that I can bring it to the [Black Forest Star Party](https://bfsp.org) in September 2024.

## Remote operations

The [ICOM IC-7300](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-7300) connects via USB to the Acer laptop for logging and digital modes.
This unfortunately precludes the use of the RemoteTx.net service.
That service requires that the rig be connected to a Raspberry Pi via USB.
So, I want to get a USB/printer switch so that I can decide whether to control the rig remotely via RemoteTx.net or use it locally.

## Modes and skills

### Morse code

I took the first two CWOps courses in Spring 2020, but I have only made two CW contacts.
I'm slow to copy, and it's hard, and so I've gotten discouraged.

But I haven't given up.

<!-- ### Unusual digital modes -->

<!-- ### More contesting -->

<!-- ### Rapid Activation and Deployment Amateur Radio (RaDAR) -->

<!-- I have ambitions of organizing some operations in the spirit of [RaDAR](https://radarops.co.za). -->

### Satellite operations

The addition of the new [IC-9700](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-9700) makes satellite operations a new frontier to explore.

## Station enhancements

### NodeRed

I was experimenting with NodeRed in the Winter of 2022-23, but have taken my server offline temporarily.

### Grounding

I plan to install a new/improved Earth ground for my electrical service.
Once that is done, then I will tie my RF/antenna ground to it.

## Events

### W3E/N3S Middle of Nowhere

My friend K3YV has noted that the [geographic center of Pennsylvania](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Geographic+Centerpoint+of+Pennsylvania/@40.8749959,-77.8027726,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89cea388797d671d:0xc7b0ef303aa96860!8m2!3d40.8749959!4d-77.8027726!16s%2Fg%2F11f57hn75t?entry=ttu) a is not far from State College.
One day soon, we plan to activate that location with a special event station.
