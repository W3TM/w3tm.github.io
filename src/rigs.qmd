This page describes my rigs and a bit about how I use them.
There are separate sections for HF rigs, VHF/UHF rigs, HTs, hotspots, and speciality radios like APRS beacons and trackers.

## HF

### FlexRadio 6400

![Flex-6400](https://edge.flexradio.com/www/offload/20221117142900/FlexRadio_products-2020_6400_45-left_9040-2400x2400px__08082.1594670218.1280.1280__62153.1668463138.1280.1280.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

I acquired this radio used in the summer of 2021. It has the internal antenna tuning unit (ATU).

It connects to an [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k) on the Input 1 port.

### ICOM IC-7300

![ICOM IC-7300](https://static.dxengineering.com/global/images/prod/xlarge/ico-ic-7300_it_xl.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

This radio was new when I bought it in the summer of 2016.

It also connects to the [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k) on the Input 2 port.

### ICOM IC-705

![ICOM IC-705](https://static.dxengineering.com/global/images/prod/xlarge/ico-ic-705_xl.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

I bought this radio new in the fall of 2020. This radio currently sits on my desk in my upstairs office.

### Elecraft KX2

I bought the Elecraft KX2 used in the summer of 2022.

### Flex 1500

![Flex 1500](https://k0pir.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1500frontsmall-300x200.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

I'd heard great things about this little rig, so when one became available on QRZ.com, I bought it.

I *love* the [PowerSDR software](https://ke9ns.com/flexpage.html) that KE9NS has lovingly kept improving.
You can *drive* the radio without ever moving your hands from the keyboard!

::: {.callout-note}

Yes, I have too many radios.
Show me a ham who loves the hobby who doesn't.

### QCX+ 

![QCX+](https://qrp-labs.com/images/qcxp/0/20200621_012756.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

In the Winter of 2020, a group of club members built the [QRP Labs](https://qrp-labs.com) QCX+ CW transceivers for the 40 m band.

## VHF/UHF

### ICOM IC-9700

![](https://www.gigaparts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/dfaec006bd6782dbad92b9435baa8bcf/i/c/ic_9700.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

The IC-9700 is the newest rig in the shack.
I'm planning some additional VHF and UHF work with it, including satellites, and possibly a future APRStt project.
But for now, it's in the shack being used for local repeater operations.

I have experimented with remote control of this rig, but the latency is high.

More details about specific uses of the IC-9700 can be found [here](ic-9700.qmd).

### ICOM IC-705

![ICOM IC-705](https://static.dxengineering.com/global/images/prod/xlarge/ico-ic-705_xl.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

The IC-705 is also capable of VHF and UHF operations at up to 10 W.
I use this rig to monitor the local VHF and UHF repeaters and to connect to the [W3SWL-10](https://aprs.fi/info/a/W3SWL-10) Winlink node.

### Kenwood TM-710GA {}

![Kenwood TM-710G](https://kasc.kenwood.com/files/website/categories/11/comm/amateur-vhf_uhf_mobiles2.png){.fig-center width=60%}

This VHF (2 m)/UHF (70 cm) transceiver was purchased new in the summer of 2016.
It is installed in our Kia Forte.
I usually beacon APRS packets when I am mobile under the callsign [W3TM-1](https://aprs.fi/info/a/W3TM-1).

### Yaesu FTM-400XDR

![Yaesu FTM-400XDR](https://www.yaesu.com/ProductImages/FTM-400DRXDR_thumb.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

I bought the FTM-400 new in the box from K3ARL in the summer of 2022. 
He had bought it as a gift for his business partner and friend, Eric Brooks N3EB.
Sadly, N3EB died in the fall of 2021, and never got to enjoy the radio.
N3EB was one of my Elmers, and so I am glad that I get to enjoy this rig and remember Eric.
I use this rig to beacon APRS packets under [W3TM-2](https://aprs.fi/info/a/W3TM-2).

### Kenwood TM-281A

![Kenwood TM-281A](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/u1YAAOSwMvFivUWN/s-l500.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

The Kenwood TM-281A is a mobile radio, but I use it in my home shack to support my [W3TM-11 I-Gate](https://aprs.fi/info/a/W3TM-11).

### Tytera TYT TH-8600

![Tytera TYT TH-8600](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d1V-d4B4L._AC_SX679_.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

This radio is the core of a go-box I use in mobile/portable operations.

## HTs

### ICOM ID-51A

![ICOM ID-51A](https://static.dxengineering.com/global/images/prod/xlarge/ico-id51aplus2bk_us_xl.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

### Yaesu FT-70D

![Yaesu FT-70D](https://www.yaesu.com/ProductImages/FT-70DR_thumb.jpg){.fig-center}

### Kenwood TH-72A

![Kenwood TH-72A](https://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d72a/images/image_product01_big.jpg){.fig-center}

I bought the [Kenwood TH-72A](https://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d72a/) used several years ago.
This rigs are notable for supporting full duplex, a desirable characteristic for FM satellite work.

## Hotspots

### ClearNode

![ClearNode Allstar hotspot/node](https://www.node-ventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CN_1_med.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

I run a UHF [ClearNode](https://node-ventures.com) Allstar hotspot.
My Allstar node number is 51401.

## APRS gear

### TNC-X kit

I have an unbuilt TNC-X kit.
This is a board that connects with a Raspberry Pi.

### Byonics MicroTrak AIO

![](https://www.byonics.com/images/mt-aio-2a.300.jpg){.fig-center width=60%}

This is a 10 W APRS beacon.

I have used this to beacon APRS packets at the NARC Field Day.

Once, when this was my _only_ mobile APRS solution, I used this to plan a meeting with a person who had a short window of time to hand-off a piece of equipment.
The beacon helped them time when to come down to meet me.

<!-- ### Mobilinkd TNC2 -->

<!-- ![](http://www.mobilinkd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20170405_205938.gif) -->
<!-- This TNC2 can connect via Bluetooth with a computer, (iOS or Android) tablet, or (iOS or Android) phone and enables a simple HT to provide nearly full APRS capabilities. -->
