Amateur radio has so many ways to be "radio-active". Here are some of the ways I enjoy engaging in our amazing hobby.

## American Radio Relay League (ARRL)

I am an active member of the [ARRL](https://arrl.org), and receive email from the ARRL reflector using my_callsign\@arrl.net.

## Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)

I participate in the weekly ARES net on the W3YA 146.85 repeater as a participating station and as a net control station.

In addition, I enjoy providing communications for various special events via the ARES organization.

## Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC)

I have been a member of NARC since 2016. I help maintain the club's station on top of Pine Grove Mountain, and I have served on the Board of Directors since 2020.

I was named the Ham of the Year (HOTY) for 2019, probably the last time I'll ever be considered a "hottie".

And the club gave me a special award in 2023 for work above and beyond the call of toilet duty in servicing our porta potty prior to Field Day 2023.
It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it.
And since I use the thing more often than most, believe me, it's self-serving.

## Penn State Amateur Radio Club (PSARC)

For several years, I served as the faculty adviser for the Penn State ARC, and as trustee for the K3CR repeaters.
Dave Cubanski has now taken over those duties.

## Quarter Century Wireless Association (QCWA)

Our local QCWA Chapter 203 has a weekly net on Sunday nights at 8:30 PM local time on the [W3YA](https://www.qrz.com/db/w3ya) 146.85 MHz (-600 kHz; 146.2 Hz) repeater. 
I am one of the net control stations.
