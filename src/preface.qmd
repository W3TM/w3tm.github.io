I've wanted to be a ham since I was a teen.

I started out as a shortwave listener with a long wire strung from my parents' roof on our house in southwest Denver running to Yaesu FRG-7 receiver.
Hearing the English language broadcast from Radio Tirana in Albania was one of the highlights.

In the spring of 1993, I got the ham bug again and studied for an passed my Technician Plus exam, including the 5 wpm code requirement.
My callsign was N3QLO.
But I had just gotten married and just started graduate school.
So, I made one contact on a Radio Shack HT and largely forgot about ham radio.
In fact, when my license renewal rolled around in 2003, I didn't even bother to renew.

Thirteen years later, I'd gotten tenure, my kids were teens or out of the house, and I had a little more time and energy.
I passed my Technician and General license exams in the summer of 2016, secured the vanity callsign K3ROG, and joined the [Nittany Amateur Radio Club](https://nittany-arc.net).
This time, I made time for ham radio, and I've been rolling ever since.
With the help of some study partners and my Elmer K3YV, I upgraded to Extra a year later.

In the winter of 2023, I changed callsigns again to W3TM, mostly on a lark.
I saw that a callsign that was both phonetically short and CW-short was available, and so I decided to enter the callsign lottery when it became available.
My understanding was that the chances were slim I would get the callsign, but I thought I would go for it anyway.
Sure enough, there was only one other ham who was eligible, and I won the coin toss at the FCC.
Ok, maybe they have a more sophisticated system of choosing randomly, but however it went down, whiskey-three-tango-mike was now my new call.
And that call will remain until I am a silent key.
