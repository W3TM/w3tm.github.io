Amateur radio has so many ways to be "radio-active". Here are some of the ways I enjoy engaging in our amazing hobby.

## Organizations

### American Radio Relay League (ARRL)

I am an active member of the [ARRL](https://arrl.org).

### Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)

I participate in the weekly ARES net on the W3YA 146.85 repeater as a participating station and as a net control station.

In addition, I enjoy providing communications for various special events via the ARES organization.

### Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC)

I have been a member of NARC since 2016. I help maintain the club's station on top of Pine Grove Mountain, and I have served on the Board of Directors since 2020.

### Penn State Amateur Radio Club (PSARC)

For several years, I served as the faculty adviser for the Penn State ARC, and as trustee for the K3CR repeaters.

### Quarter Century Wireless Association (QCWA)

Our local QCQA Chapter 203 has a weekly net on Sunday nights at 8:30 PM local time on the W3YA 146.85 MHz repeater. I am one of the net control stations. 

## Other activities

### Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)

I operate a receive-only VHF (144.390 MHz) I-Gate under the callsign [W3TM-11](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FW3TM-11&timerange=3600&tail=3600).

In December 2023, I started experimenting with supporting [APRS-tt](http://www.aprs.org/aprstt.html) using the [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) software TNC.
Early experiments look promising.
We're discussing setting up a network of APRS-tt iGates to provide better receive coverage in our very hilly area.

## Events

### Field Day

For the last several years, I have helped organize the NARC Field Day operation.

In the summer of 2020, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, I operated from my backyard.

### Winter Field Day

I enjoy [Winter Field Day](https://www.winterfieldday.com).

In January 2020, W3SWL, N3LI, and I operated Winter Field Day from a cabin in Prince Gallitzin State Park.

In 2021, my wife and I stayed at a cabin in Black Moshannon State Park where I operated Winter Field Day.

In 2022, friends KC3HIP and W3EDP stayed with us in an adjoining cabin at Black Moshannon State Park.

We weren't able to operate in 2023, but hope to do so again in 2024.

### Jamboree on the Air (JOTA)

With K3YV and W3EDP, we planned an event with local Cub Scout Pack 67 for October 2022.
Illness forced a last minute cancellation, but carried out a JOTA activation for October 21, 2023 under the K3J special event callsign.
About 15 cubs and their parents joined K3YV, W3EDP, KC3AF, and me at Circleville Park for some HF, VHF repeater, Morse Code, and FRS walkie-talkie fun.

### Birthplace of Memorial Day W3M

### Flight 93 20th Anniversary N3M

Several hams from NARC cooperated with hams from the Somerset County Amateur Radio club to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Flight 93 from a location near the memorial.

### Penn State Dance Marathon K3T

I helped the Penn State ARC secure the special event callsign K3T for an event honoring the Penn State Dance Marathon held in February 2023.
The group of operators made several hundred QSOs, spreading positive news about 'Thon, Penn State, and the PSU club.

### Pride K3P

With several friends from our local ham community, I organized a special event station to celebrate Pride Month in Central PA in early June 2023.
My Allstar/EchoLink node was active, and a group of us did a Parks on the Air (POTA) activation at Bald Eagle State Park.
We also had a booth at the State College Pride festival.

## Education

### W5YI VE

I was a volunteer examiner (VE) for several years via the W5YI-VEC and continue with active credentials.

### ARRL CVE

As of September 2023, I will be taking over the Liaison VE role from K3YV.
We have moved our exams to the ARRL-VEC.

### New Ham Book

Just for fun, I've started working on an electronic (web) book for new hams.
The target audience was initially Penn State ARC members who aren't (yet) licensed.
But I am expanding it to be suitable for a wide range of folks who aren't yet hams.

## Awards

### NARC Ham of the Year (HOTY)

I was named the Ham of the Year for 2019 by my local club.

### King Crapper

My club gave me a special award in 2023 for work above and beyond the call of toilet duty in servicing our porta potty prior to Field Day 2023.
