Hi, everyone.
I grabbed the W3TM.org domain from name.com.
Interestingly, W3TM.com was *not* available.
That is a possibly interesting and longer story that I imagine could involve
the former holder of this callsign.

I migrated the site from some older code, and borrowed heavily for formatting
ideas from the excellent [Quarto site](https://quarto.org).

This will be the new home for documenting ham web activities once I get the site in good shape.
Until then, I'll be testing use of the GitHub pages site building feature.
That means the site will live at https://w3tm.github.io for a bit.
