have recently rejoined the [Central Pennsylania Observers (CPO)](https://cpoclub.org), our local amateur astronomy club.\nBack in the late 1990s, I built a 6\" Dobsonian telescope with several other club members.\nIt was a blast.\n\nThe club is gearing up for multiple activities in 2024, including a trip to Erie, PA to watch the eclipse.\n\nOne of the activities involves encouraging members to build home radiotelescopes and to contribute data to the [Radio JOVE project](https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov).\nSo, I ordered the kit, and it arrived late last week.\n\nThe kit consists of a pair of dipole antennas tuned to ~20 MHz, a combiner, some coax feed lines and phasing lines, and a software defined radio (SDR).\nIf I have time to put the pieces together before April 8, but if not, I'll get it online in the next couple of months.\n\nI love the project for many reasons not least of which is the fact that it combines two of my favorite hobbies.\nNow, if I could just figure out how to combine ham radio and banjos.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/newsletters/2023Dec/index.html#10](https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/newsletters/2023Dec/art1fig4a.png)\n\nI
