show-off our amazing hobby.\n\n\nFor the last several years, I have helped organize the NARC Field Day operation.\n\n![NARC Field Day 2022](img/narc-field-day-2022.jpeg){.fig-center}\n\nIn the summer of 2020, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, I operated from my backyard.\n\n![Field Day from home 2020](img/k3rog-field-day-2020.jpeg){.fig-center}\n\n## Winter Field Day\n\nI enjoy [Winter Field Day](https://www.winterfieldday.com).\n\nIn January 2020, [W3SWL](https://qrz.com/db/w3swl), [N3LI](https://qrz.com/db/n3li), and I operated Winter Field Day from a cabin in [Prince Gallitzin State Park](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/PrinceGallitzinStatePark/Pages/default.aspx).\n\n### WFD 2021\n\nIn 2021, my wife and I stayed at a cabin in [Black Moshannon State Park](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/BlackMoshannonStatePark/Pages/default.aspx) for Winter Field Day.\n\n### WFD 2022\n\nIn 2022, friends [KC3HIP](https://qrz.com/db/kc3hip) and [W3EDP](https://qrz.com/db/w3edp) stayed with us in an adjoining cabin at [Black Moshannon State Park](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/BlackMoshannonStatePark/Pages/default.aspx).\n\n### WFD 2024\n\nWe weren't able to operate in 2023, but I operated from Black Moshannon State Park in 2024. \nGear included the [Yaesu FT-891](https://w3tm.org/shack/rigs.html#ft-891), the [RM Italy MLA100](https://w3tm.org/shack/amplifiers.html#rm-italy-mla100) amplifier, and an end-fed halfwave for 80m+. \nI tried connecting to the W3SWL-10 Winlink node using the [\"Alaskan\" Arrow Antenna](https://w3tm.org/shack/antennas.html#alaskan-arrow-antenna) and the W3YA-3 packet station, but failed. \nAfter returning home, I understood why:\n\n![Black Moshannon to W3SWL-10](img/black-mo-to-w3swl.png)\n\n![Black Moshannon to W3YA-3](img/black-mo-to-w3ya.png)\n\nThere were no line of sight paths. \nThe Allegheny Front lay between us.\nWelcome to Pennsylvania.\n\n## [Jamboree on the Air (JOTA)](https://www.jotajoti.info)\n\nWith K3YV and W3EDP, I planned an event with local Cub Scout Pack 67 for October 2022.\nIllness forced a last minute cancellation, but we carried out a JOTA activation for October 21, 2023 under the K3J special event callsign.\nAbout 15 cubs and their parents joined K3YV, W3EDP, KC3AF, and me at Circleville Park for some HF, VHF repeater, Morse Code, and FRS walkie-talkie fun.\nWe're looking forward to repeating and expanding the effort in 2024.\nHowever, given the cold and blustery weather conditions, we're looking for an indoor location.\n\n## Birthplace of Memorial Day W3M\n\n![W3M QSL Card](img/w3m-qsl.png)\nNARC club members operated W3M from our home stations during the 2020 and 2021 pandemic years.\nK3YV and I operated from the grounds of the Boal Mansion in 2022.\nWe hope to operate the station in some future year.\nMany hams told us the were glad to hear about this bit of local history.\n\n## Flight 93 20th Anniversary N3M\n\n![N3M QSL card](img/n3m-qsl.png)\n\nSeveral hams from NARC cooperated with hams from the Somerset County Amateur Radio club to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Flight 93 from a location near the memorial.\n\n![N3M special event operation](img/n3m-2021.jpeg)\n\n## Penn State Dance Marathon K3T\n\nI helped the Penn State ARC secure the special event callsign K3T for an event honoring the Penn State Dance Marathon held in February 2023.\nThe group of operators made several hundred QSOs, spreading positive news about 'Thon, Penn State, and the PSU club.\n\n## Pride K3P\n\nWith several friends from our local ham community, I organized a special event station to celebrate Pride Month in Central PA in early June 2023.\nMy W3TM-L Allstar/EchoLink node was active, and a group of us did a Parks on the Air (POTA) activation at Bald Eagle State Park.\nWe also had a booth at the State College Pride festival.\n\n![K3P QSL
