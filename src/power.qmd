This section describes how I power my stations.

## Mobile

The [Kenwood TM-710G](rigs.qmd#kenwood-tm-710g) is powered by a Bioenno $LiFePO_4$ 30 Ah battery.

The Yaesu [FTM-400XDR ](rigs.qmd#yaesu-ftm-400xdr) is powered by a Bioenno $LiFePO_4$ 40 Ah battery.

The advantage of using these batteries for mobile operations is that I don't have to worry about engine noise and I have a battery for other purposes.

Lately, I have been experimenting with recharging these batteries using foldable solar panels. As the experiments progress, I may consider keeping a solar panel in the car.

## Portable

### Batteries

I have two [Bioenno](https://www.bioennopower.com) $LiFePO_4$ 12 Ah batteries that I recently purchased during a [Chameleon Antenna](https://chameleonantenna.com) sale.

My Tytera-based Go-box has an embedded Bioenno $LiFePO_4$ 12 Ah battery.

I have a small, 6 Ah Bioenno battery that I often carry with the [Elecraft KX-2](rigs.qmd#elecraft-kx2).

### Solar panels

I have a [120 W folding panel from Bionenno](https://www.bioennopower.com/collections/solar-panels/products/120-watt-foldable-solar-panel-for-charging-power-packs-bsp-120). 
I used it for Field Day from my backyard in 2020. The 30 Ah (orange) and 40 Ah (black) battery boxes can also be seen in the picture below.

I have two foldable 65 W solar panels that can be daisy-chained (in series). I used them in a recent [portable operation](img/transylvania-epic-2023.jpeg) in support of a mountain bike race.

### Charge controllers

Two charge controllers are available. [One](https://www.bioennopower.com/collections/solar-controllers/products/12v-24v-36v-48v-30a-solar-charge-controller-for-lifepo4-sc-4830jud) came with my Bioenno panels.

The other is the [BuddiPole PowerMini2](https://www.buddipole.com/powermini.html).

The PowerMini2 is a great little charge controller, but it is pricey and not often available because of high demand.
