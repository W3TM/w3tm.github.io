## Shack

I have a small room in our basement set aside for my radio shack.

### APRS I-Gate

The W3TM-11 APRS I-Gate uses the [Kenwood TM-281A](rigs.qmd#kenwood-tm-281a) connected to a Mac Mini running Ubuntu and the direwolf software TNC. I have a 2 m/70 cm J-pole antenna on the roof of my house at about 6 m from the ground.

### APRS-tt station

Since fall of 2023, I have been experimenting with an APRS-tt (touch-tone) station using the [IC-9700](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-9700) connected to an Acer Laptop running Direwolf 1.7.

The station is configured to log-in to the APRS-IS network under W3TM-8. When the right sequence of DTMF tones is entered, I (and a couple of ham friends) are able to have our positions reported nearby some locations that are relevant to area hams: our mountaintop club station, the 146.85 W3YA and 146.76 W3GA repeaters, Hoss's Restaurant, and the location where we hold our monthly club meetings.

More specific details about the rig and PC settings for this station can be found [here](ic-9700.qmd#aprs-tt).

### HF 1

My primary HF station that I am callig HF-1 just for fun uses the [FlexRadio 6400](rigs.qmd#flexradio-6400) transceiver.
The Flex drives an [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k).
The radio has an [Inrad M629](https://www.flexradio.com/wp-content/uploads/M629__29896.1676037008.1280.1280.jpg) microphone.
An Acer laptop running [SmartSDR 3.5.9](https://www.flexradio.com/ssdr/ssdr-for-windows/) is used to control the radio.

### HF 2

My second HF station runs an [IC-7300](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-7300).
It also connects to the [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k).
I use either the stock hand mic or a [Heil Proset iC](https://heilhamradio.com/product/pro-set/#dipipopup-9149) headset with a footswitch.

## Office

I have a home office that I also use as an operating position.

### HF 3 (QRP/VHF/UHF)

A third HF station is located in my office.
I'm running the [IC-705](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-705).
At the moment, the HF capability is receive-only, as I have a [W6LVP](https://www.w6lvp.com/product/w6lvp-amplified-receive-only-magnetic-loop-antenna/) receive only magnetic loop for the HF antenna.
The VHF/UHF side of the rig is connected to a slim jim antenna.
Both antennas connect via a diplexer.

### Allstar node

I have a [ClearNode](https://www.node-ventures.com/buy-clearnode/) UHF Allstar node on 51401.
The node also supports EchoLink (W3TM-L).

I used this node for the K3P Special Event station in June 2023. At least two hams connected via the node to participate in the event.
