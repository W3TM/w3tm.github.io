## W5YI VE

I was a volunteer examiner (VE) for several years via the W5YI-VEC and continue with active credentials.

## ARRL CVE

As of September 2023, I assumed the Coordinating Volunteer Examiner (CVE) role from K3YV.
We have moved our exams to the [ARRL-VEC](https://www.arrl.org/volunteer-examiners).

I'm pleased to say that our team has "minted" almost 10 hams.

## NARC Elmering Committee

[NARC](https://nittany-arc.net) has formed a new committee to help new hams get started.

## New Ham Book

Just for fun, I've started working on an electronic (web) book for new hams.
The target audience was initially Penn State ARC members who aren't (yet) licensed.
But I am expanding it to be suitable for a wide range of folks who aren't yet hams.

You can find the work-in-progress here:
