My name is Rick Gilmore. 
My callsign is W3TM.
I am an FCC-licensed amateur radio operator, otherwise known as a ham.

Not HAM.
It's not an abbreviation.
Yes, people still do that.
It's an amazing hobby.
Why is it called "ham" radio?
There are lots of stories, but no one is sure.
But if you're a ham, you're a ham all the way...

This site describes some of my ham radio activities.
