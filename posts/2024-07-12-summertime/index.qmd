I thought this would be a quiet summer. I thought wrong. Let's just say that one thing led to another. But, I did get to enjoy our glorious hobby from time to time.

My club held Field Day at our mountaintop shack in the middle of a heatwave. A few crazies operated portable, but within the 500' radius permitted under the ARRL rules.

Michelle helped support the Ironman Happy Valley 70.3 event. I fried my Yaesu FTM-400XDR in the process, but plan to repurpose it as a dedicated APRS digipeater.

And I reorganized the entire shack...again.

Time for a vacation?
