One of my news feeds featured an announcement about a new version of the [DigiPi](https://digipi.org) software.

I ordered a new Pi Zero 2W, dug a micro SD card out of a drawer, and connected it to my IC-705.

Oh my, this is going to be fun: APRS messaging, iGate, Winlink via Pat, and if I have an HF antenna, FT8, JS8Call, and fldigi.

The Pi serves all of this through a web browser.

I've put a very minimal set of [how-to steps](https://w3tm.github.io/shack/ic-705.html#digipi) in my shack guide.
