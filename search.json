    "text": "After a fantastic trip to Hamvention last week, I’m back in the ham saddle again this week supporting two special events: A statewide mass casualty drill with the Red Cross and the Trans-Sylvania Mountain Bike Epic.\nThe Red Cross event involved deploying to a location in Milesburg, PA and setting up a remote station capable of sending and receiving Winlink messages. I used the Yaesu FT-891, an Evolve III (12 V) notebook, a SOTABeams 20m/40m linked dipole, and a SOTABeams portable mast with a drive-on mount. Two 60 W solar panels kept the Bioenno 40 Ah battery charged. Band conditions were much better than the dry run two week ago. Geography made a VHF Winlink connection to the W3SWL-10 node unlikely, so we had to use a hotspot and Telnet. Yesterday, however, we were successful in sending three Winlink messages on 40 m. We also used the W3GA (146.76) repeater for local communication. It was very hot, so we were glad for the shade of the popup and the AC and tasty lunch ready for us inside the Milesburg Community Center.\n\n\n\nCommunications station outside the Milesburg Community Center\n\n\nThe post-event beverage at Voodoo Brewing Company made it an especially excellent day.\nToday, I supported Stage 4/2 of the Trans-Sylvania Mountain Bike Epic by providing communications at Aid Station 1. The humidity and temperature had dropped from earlier in the week, and so it was fun to support the cyclists participating in the event using the new Yaesu FT-5DR I acquired at Hamvention. Aside from some differing opinions about my audio quality, I really like the rig. I got there early, and that gave me time to try-out the KX-2 and a new Jackite 31’ pole that also followed me home from Hamvention.\n\n\n\nJackite 31’ pole deployed near Bear Meadows\n\n\nBoth events provide outstanding opportunities to play radio and practice setting them up and taking them down. Every time I do this, I learn something. I’m no where near perfect, but I am getting better. Or as K3YV might say, ‘more gooder.’"

Back in the late 1990s, I built a 6” Dobsonian telescope with several other club members. It was a blast.\nThe club is gearing up for multiple activities in 2024, including a trip to Erie, PA to watch the eclipse.\nOne of the activities involves encouraging members to build home radiotelescopes and to contribute data to the Radio JOVE project. So, I ordered the kit, and it arrived late last week.\nThe kit consists of a pair of dipole antennas tuned to ~20 MHz, a combiner, some coax feed lines and phasing lines, and a software defined radio (SDR). If I have time to put the pieces together before April 8, but if not, I’ll get it online in the next couple of months.\nI love the project for many reasons not least of which is the fact that it combines two of my favorite hobbies. Now, if I could just figure out how to combine ham radio and banjos."

Hearing the English language broadcast from Radio Tirana in Albania was one of the highlights.\nIn the spring of 1993, I got the ham bug again and studied for an passed my Technician Plus exam, including the 5 wpm code requirement. My call sign was N3QLO. But I had just gotten married and just started graduate school. So, I made one contact on a Radio Shack HT and largely forgot about ham radio. In fact, when my license renewal rolled around in 2003, I didn’t even bother to renew.\nThirteen years later, I’d gotten tenure, my kids were teens or out of the house, and I had a little more time and energy. I passed my Technician and General license exams in the summer of 2016, secured the vanity callsign K3ROG, and joined the Nittany Amateur Radio Club. This time, I made time for ham radio, and I’ve been rolling ever since. With the help of some study partners and my Elmer K3YV, I upgraded to Extra a year later.\nIn the winter of 2023, I changed callsigns again to W3TM, mostly on a lark. I saw that a call sign that was both phonetically short and CW-short was available, and so I decided to enter the call sign lottery when it became available. My understanding was that the chances were slim I would get the call sign, but I thought I would go for it anyway. Sure enough, there was only one other ham who was eligible, and I won the coin toss at the FCC. Ok, maybe they have a more sophisticated system of choosing randomly, but however it went down, whiskey-three-tango-mike was now my new call. And that call will remain until I am a silent key."
