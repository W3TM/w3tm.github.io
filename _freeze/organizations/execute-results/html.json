The following shows some data about the exams I have coordinated since I took over these duties from K3YV in the fall of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nSince 2023-11-14, our team has administered *n*= 23 exams to *n*= 21 candidates.\n\nHere is the distribution of successful exams by class.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Ham exams statistics](organizations_files/figure-html/fig-ham-exam-stats-1.png){#fig-ham-exam-stats width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## American Radio Relay League (ARRL)\n\nI am an active member of the [ARRL](https://arrl.org), and receive email from the ARRL reflector using my_callsign\\@arrl.net.\n\n## Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)\n\nI participate in the weekly (Sunday night, 9:00 pm local time) ARES net on the W3YA 146.85 repeater as a participating station and as a net control station.\nHere are some upcoming dates when I will serve as net control:\n\n| Date |\n|------|\n| 21 April 2024 |\n| 9 June 2024 |\n| 28 June 2024 |\n\nHere is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p3o7b1dfbSQFBdolpK4mxtBu5Ck3INsYxUwQgcxkUSw/edit?usp=sharing) to the roster.\n\nIn addition, I enjoy providing communications for various special events via the ARES organization.\n\n## Penn State Amateur Radio Club (PSARC)\n\nFor several years, I served as the faculty adviser for the Penn State ARC, and as trustee for the K3CR repeaters.\nDave Cubanski has now taken over those duties.\n\n## Quarter Century Wireless Association (QCWA)\n\nOur local QCWA Chapter 203 has a weekly net on Sunday nights at 8:30 PM local time on the [W3YA](https://www.qrz.com/db/w3ya) 146.85 MHz (-600 kHz; 146.2 Hz) repeater. \nI am one of the net control stations.\n\n## Pennsylvania Narrow Band Emergency Messaging Service (PA NBEMS)\n\nWhen I have time, I check-in to the Sunday 7:30 am PA NBEMS digital modes net on 3.583 MHz. The net has a groups.io site at <https://groups.io/g/panbems>. The net uses [THOR22](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/THOR) for check-ins and then traffic is passed using MFSK32 or THOR56.\n\nI've successfully checked in from Tioga County when on vacation there, and from home, sometimes running QRP.\n\nI have also checked-in to the New Jersey NBEMS net.\n",
